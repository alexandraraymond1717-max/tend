# Tend ✦

**A life design companion for intentional living.**

Tend helps you step back from the day-to-day and thoughtfully design a life that reflects what actually matters to you. It's not a calendar—it's a space for reflection, intention-setting, and mindful planning.

## The Flow

1. **Year View** — Start with the big picture. What do you want this year to *feel* like?
2. **Season View** — Move through each season with intention. What do you want to cultivate? What do you want to release?
3. **Month View** — Get specific. Plan the moments that matter.

## Features

- AI-guided reflection conversations
- Visual timeline for planning trips, rest, date nights, personal time
- Partner event tracking (shared moments marked as "shared")
- Seasonal and cyclical approach to life design

## Tech

Currently a single-page HTML/React app. No build step required.

## Running Locally

Just open `index.html` in your browser, or:

```bash
# If you have Python installed
python3 -m http.server 8080
# Then visit http://localhost:8080
```

## What's Next

- [ ] Claude API integration for real AI conversations
- [ ] Data persistence (localStorage → database)
- [ ] Partner syncing
- [ ] Mobile app
